Redoing the final assignment for the Artificial Intelligence subject at the University of New South Wales. A tiled-based adventure game has been created in Java by the university. It creates a map of various items and obstacles in which the agent has to navigate to grab the treasure and return to their original starting point. 
The agent is placed in the environment and can only see a 5 by 5 tile view of their surroundings. Inputs are then fed into the game to move forward, turn, etc. 
The goal is to make a more sophisticated **planning agent** than my original attempt. In the first version I used basic control structures to simulate prioritising certain moves and moving to higher heuristic squares. In the new version I want to develop a planning module that uses predicted states of it's actions effects on the environment and can make complicated plans, using informed search methods on these states.
